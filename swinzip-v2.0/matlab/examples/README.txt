This folder contains driver Matlab code that can be run to show the
capabilities of the library. Description of each example can be found at the
beginning of each script.

This folder also contains two jpg photos depicting comparison between different
data reconstruction using different compression schemes for two different data
fields represented on a regular square grid. The compression methods considered
are:

- Compressed Sensing using Alpert multi-wavelets
- zfp Floating Point Compression:

- Vector Quantization:
